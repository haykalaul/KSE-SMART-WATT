# Client (Vite) environment example
# Copy to .env (in client/) or set envs in your hosting provider

# Mode used by client: development | production
VITE_MODE=development

# Backend API base URL (point to the Go server)
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080

# JWT secret is only used client-side if the app expects a secret (not recommended).
# Prefer storing secrets on the server. If needed for local dev tests only:
VITE_JWT_SECRET=replace_with_local_secret

# NOTE about tokens:
# Do NOT put private API tokens (like HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN) directly in client-side envs for
# production apps. If you need to call external AI APIs, proxy requests through the server
# where the real token is stored (see server/.env.example for HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN).
